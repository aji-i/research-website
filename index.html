					Home vs. School: A comparative perspective of face-to-face and online classes of selected 
						Junior and Senior High School students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc.
													School Year 2022-2023
				</header>
				<p>
					On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. 
					The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus caused them to be alarmed due to the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases. 
					The governments of every country implemented different health protocols to ensure the safety of their people, but due to late declaration in some countries, their damage control plans for viruses didn’t work. 
					COVID-19 limits many things, including the implementation of face-to-face classes. 
					Due to the risk to students' and teachers' health and safety, DepEd has prohibited the implementation of face-to-face classes to mitigate the rapid growth of the COVID-19 case. On the other hand, DepEd implemented learning modalities to ensure that studies could continue even in the midst of a pandemic. 
					They implemented modular learning, blended learning, and online learning in the new learning setup, which students will select based on their abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditional classroom or face-to-face classroom was the preferred method of learning prior to the pandemic. 
					It occurs when a teacher and students of a nonprofit educational institution are in a location dedicated to instruction and teaching and learning occur concurrently. 
					All performances and displays of a work are permitted in this setting. Face-to-face classes boost study motivation and provide immediate feedback. 
					It is also more adaptable because the teacher and student meet in person. Because there is direct interaction between students and teachers, it is much easier to entertain student questions and understand the lessons.

					Abstract
				</header>
				<p>
					This research study aims to asses “Home vs. School: A comparative perspective of face-to-face and online classes of junior and senior high school students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. School Year 2022-2023.” 
					This study primarily aims to at comparing face-to-face classes and online classes via analysis of selected Junior Highschool and Senior Highschool Students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. School Year 2022-2023. 
				</p>
				<p> Specifically, it sought to answer the following: What is the profile of the respondents in terms of sex, age, geographical location, and internet connection; 
					What is the most preferred learning modality of the selected Junior Highschool and Senior Highschool Students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. School Year 2022-2023; 
					Is there a significant difference between the preferences of the selected Junior high and Senior High School students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. School Year 2022-2023 in their preferred learning modality.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this study the researchers applied the quantitative-qualitative technique in this study. 
					The quantitative-qualitative technique was used in this study because the research method contains three parts. 
					Part I and Part II of the questionnaires requires the respondents to check because it’s a checklist. 
					Part III requires the respondents to answer the 5 questions because it’s an essay type format.
				</p>
				<p>  
					The respondents of this study is composed of 60 random selected respondents, each from Grade 7 to Grade 12 from different strands of St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. S.Y. 2022-2023.
				</p>
				<p>  
					The major instrument of this study was a questionnaire. 
					 Part I seeks to answer the profile of the respondents in terms of sex, age, geographical location, and internet connection. 
					 Next is Part II, a checklist comprised of 5 questions with the scale besides it (1-5) and the verbal interpretations equal to it. 
					 Lastly, Part III comprised of five questions that probed the respondents’ insights, perceptions, as well as their experiences in face-to-face and online classes. 
					 The questionnaire also includes questions that will showcase the preferences of the respondents in regards with what the better learning method is to learn and study on.

					Findings
				</header>
				<p> 
					The findings revealed that most of the respondents are female, with a frequency of 37 or 61.67 percent, and those who are male have a frequency of 23 or 38.33 percent. This signifies that most of the respondents are female. 
					In terms of age, it showed that those 14–17-year-old respondents are in the first rank with a frequency of 37, or 61.67 percent; those 13 years old or younger respondents are in the second rank with a frequency of 19 or 31.67 percent; and those 18 years old or older are ranked last with a frequency of 4 or 6.67 percent. This signifies that most of the respondents are 14–17 years old. 
					Most of the respondents live in población, with a frequency of 44 or 73.33 percent. It is clear that the majority of respondents use Wi-Fi at a frequency of 52 or 86.67 percent, while those who use mobile data at a frequency of 8 or 13.33 percent. This signifies that most of the respondents use Wi-Fi.

					Conclusions
				</header>
				<p>  
					Based on the findings for question number 1, majority or most of the respondents answered that face-to-face is fun, interesting, and much easier for them to learn. 
					The researchers might have concluded based from answers for question number 2 that the majority of the respondents are having difficulties in online classes as they are facing different problems and also, might have come to conclusion that the respondents prefer face-to-face classes more than online classes.
					For question number 3, although having quite the same number of answers on the efficiency between the two, the majority have answered that online classes are far more efficient in all of the variables (Sex, Age, Geographical Location, and Internet connection). 
					In question number 4, majority of the respondents have a higher chance of learning when it comes to face-to-face classes, unlike in online classes, they find it hard to learn because of poor internet connection, hard to focus, and environmental unnecessary noises. 
					Lastly, for question number 5, the respondents in all of the variables (Sex, Age, Geographical Location, and Internet connection) have answered face-to-face classes are what they like the most because for them, it’s less hassle and much easier, whether what their sex is, or age, where they live, or what internet connection they have at home.
				<p>  
					The hypothesis was rejected because there is a significant difference between the preferences of the selected junior and senior high school students in St. Therese School of Tanay, Inc. School Year 2022-2023 in their preferred learning modality in terms of age, sex, geographical location and the internet connection they have at home. 
				<p>  
					Sex and age do not influence students' perceptions of what type of learning technique they prefer, but geographical location and internet access do affect the students' preferred mode of learning.
				<p>  
					Most students prefer face-to-face classes rather than online classes. Although they faced difficulties and challenges, face-to-face classes was the most preferred type of learning method because students understand the lessons in a much easier way.
